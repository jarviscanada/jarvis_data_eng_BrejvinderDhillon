summary: I'm Brejvinder, a recent graduate from the University of Windsor with a Bachelor's in Computer Science Honors. I specialize in the design and analysis of algorithms and have a foundation in theoretical computer science. I'm currently a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting where I'm being given the opportunity to apply my knowledge and hone my skills with industry-standard tools. I have an interest in artificial intelligence, data analytics and game theory. Despite being from a science background, I have a passion for creative arts, namely music and creative writing which translates back into my programing as I like to create beautiful and efficient code.

  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: Developed a tool that allows users to monitor nodes connected in a Linux cluster by tracking the hardware specifications and resource usage of the cluster nodes. The data is collected in real-time and is currently being used for report generation and future planning. The Monitoring Agents on the nodes collect and send data to the centralized database on a scheduled basis via crontab over the network. The docker initialization and SQL scripts ensure the deployment of the RDBMS with a standardized schema and environment.
